            A remarkable About page is genuine, approachable, 
            and distinguished. It should give the visitor a glimpse 
            into what working with you and your business might be like. 
            You can include personal interests, stories, and photos 
            that convey the unique story of your business.
            
            Since About pages are creative and personal to you and 
            your company, there are several ways to construct one, 
            however, the process is generally the same. So,
             let's create an About page one step by step.</i> </P>
