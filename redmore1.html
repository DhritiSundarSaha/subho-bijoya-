           <center><h2>Vijaya Dashami or the tenth day of Durga Puja marks Goddess Durga’s victory over the demon Mahishasura.
             While much of north 
            India would celebrate the victory of Lord Ram over the demon King Ravana,
             eastern India would celebrate Goddess Durga and mark her triumph over the evil Mahishasura.<br/></center>
             

Although Durga Puja celebrations were muted this year keeping in mind the public health crisis triggered 
by the Covid19 pandemic, it could not stop people from sharing their enthusiasm and love and, of course,
 the ray of hope that this festival brings.<br>
